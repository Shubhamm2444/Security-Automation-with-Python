** Network Traffic Analysis with NetworkX
This project demonstrates using Python's NetworkX library to analyze and visualize network traffic data. We'll simulate some basic traffic flow and analyze the connections between devices.

** Explanation:
Libraries:
networkx: This library provides tools for creating, manipulating, and analyzing network graphs.
Data Representation:
The code creates a simple network graph representing connections between devices. You can replace this example with real traffic data from capture tools (e.g., Wireshark) or network monitoring systems.
Analysis Techniques:
We calculate the degree centrality of each node in the graph. This helps identify devices with the most connections, potentially acting as central points in the network.
Visualization (Optional):
While not included in this code, you can use NetworkX functions like nx.draw or libraries like Matplotlib to visualize the network graph for better understanding of traffic flow patterns.

**Running the Script:
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., network_traffic_analysis.py).
Ensure you have Python and NetworkX installed.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the python command followed by the script name:

python network_traffic_analysis.py

Explain
This will print the degree centrality scores for each device in the network. The higher the score, the more connections a device has.

Customization:
Modify the script to represent your actual network topology with more devices and connections.
Integrate real traffic data from capture tools and parse it to populate the graph dynamically.
Explore NetworkX visualization features or use Matplotlib to create a visual representation of the network traffic flow.
Remember, this is a basic example. You can extend it to analyze more complex network traffic scenarios and gain valuable insights into your network activity.

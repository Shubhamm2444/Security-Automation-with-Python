** Project: Automating Vulnerability Scanning with Python
This project demonstrates automating vulnerability scanning on internal servers using Python scripting

** Explanation:
Libraries:
subprocess: This module allows us to execute system commands from within the Python script.

Vulnerability Scanner Integration:
The code snippet assumes you have a vulnerability scanner installed and accessible through the command line. Replace vuln_scanner with the actual command used by your specific scanner.

Error Handling (Optional):
Consider adding error handling mechanisms to capture potential issues during the scanning process. This could involve checking the return code of the subprocess.run command or using try-except blocks.

Security Considerations:
Avoid including sensitive information like scanner credentials or server details directly in the script. You can explore environment variables or configuration files for secure storage and access.

** Running the Script:
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., vulnerability_scan.py).
Ensure you have the vulnerability scanner installed and accessible from the command line.
Make sure Python is installed and configured on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the python command followed by the script name:
 
 python vulnerability_scan.py

** Explain
This will trigger the vulnerability scanning process for each server in the list.

** Customization:
You can modify the script to accept the server list as input from a file or command-line arguments.
Extend the functionality to parse the scanner output and generate reports or send notifications.
This example provides a basic framework for automating vulnerability scanning with Python. Remember to adapt it to your specific security tools and environment.
